# Gwent-Cards-Bot

## Add this bot to your server:
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=318804439354048537&scope=bot&permissions=0
## How to use
Anywhere you write (case insensitive), type: ["Name of card"] and the bot will reply you with all the card basic details and the image.

The bot is currently working with an algorithm that compares your input between brackets with the most similar card and the bot will give you the better option. For example, if you type [adrenaline] you will receive "Adrenaline rush" info.

Currently the bot supports English and Spanish versions of cards for Gwent.
